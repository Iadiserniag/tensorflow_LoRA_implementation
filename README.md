# Low Rank Adpatation (LoRA)

I implemented LoRA from scratch in tensorflow.

The task consists in adapting the pre-trained ALBERT ([albert-base_v2](https://huggingface.co/albert/albert-base-v2)) model to a binary classification task on the [News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection) dataset.
